            <h2>JST, Luke 23:35</h2>
            <p><b>Jesus asks forgiveness for the Roman soldiers who are crucifying Him.</b></p>
            <p>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do <i>(Meaning the soldiers who crucified him,)</i> and they parted his raiment and cast lots.</p>

            <h2>Alma 46:12, 21</h2>
            <p><b>12 </b>And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it—In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.</p>
            <p><b>21 </b>And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.</p>
